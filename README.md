# Investigate-a-Dataset

The purpose of this dataset is to find out the relationship between income per person and other three variables. The questions I propose to ask with this dataset are:

1. Do bigger increases of income per person lead to greater changes of life expectancy worldwide?
2. Does higher GDP per capita lead to the result of more children being concieved in a household worldwide?
3. What is the difference of Internet users percentages between countries that have the highest and lowest income per person? 

The datasets in the folder were from Kaggle : Global Statistics Dataset

Conclusions:

We can claim that when the change in income is greater than 0, people who make much more money every year will be less likely to have longer life expectency. We can only guess that these groups are under lots of stress to prevent them from taking good care of their health. And these people are not likely to increase fertility rates than people who have less increase in income. One assumption about this phenomenon could be that women in these families are contributing more towards business rather than staying at home. Thus, the chance of conceiving more children goes down. 

Lastly, Qatar, as the country that has the highest income per person, consists of 87.93% of population that uses Internet. This percentage is 86.26 higher than the percentage derived from the country that owns the least income per capita, which is Somilia. This huge difference in percentages is understandable since we are looking at two countries that are on the extreme ends of the spectrum. 

As of now, we cannot know any correlation or causation between these factors because we did not make graphs with trends to collect corrlations. In terms of causatoin, better technology could come from better income situations. But higher income could also be produced by the greater use of technology.
